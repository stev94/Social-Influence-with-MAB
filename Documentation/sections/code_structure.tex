\section{Code Structure}

The code is organize as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Bandit\_algs Foder:} Folder containing the bandit algorithms used in the Online Influence Maximization problem.
	\item{Policies Folder:} Folder containing all the different policies(algorithms to solve the Influence Maximizaztion problem) used in the project. They were all introduced in order to solve the problem of computational complexity.
	\item{Miscellaneous: } The remaining files are for generating graphs (GraphUtils) run the code (MainBandit, MainGreedy and SocialMain) and run Monte Carlo Simulations (MonteCarloSimulation and MonteCarloSimulationV2)
\end{itemize}
