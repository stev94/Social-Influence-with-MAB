\section{Conclusions}
This research project has the objective to analyze how various algorithms perform in the Influence Maximization and in the Online Influence Maximization problems.
We implemented almost all the known algorithms for the Influence Maximization, and analyzed their performance with different kinds of graph.
Using the code is easy to run even more experiments, changing the parameters of the algorithms(MC iteration, number of nodes, features) and the network topology (just modify the file GraphUtils.py).
Then we implemented what was requested by the project assignment for the Online Influence Maximization problem, the Linear UCB which exploits the linearity of the edges' feature, and the more simple Contextual UCB and TS.

Everything was implemented but poorly tested, due to the too high complexty of the algorithms.
If we could have the possibility to use powerful machines to do the simulations, we could achieve way better results and run our algorithms on bigger and way more complex networks.
Our poor results, however, gave us enough reasons to think that all the code implemented is correct and works well (that's sure for the Influence Maximization, almost sure for the OIM).
