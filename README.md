# Social Influence Maximization with MAB

Several implementation of MAB algorithms for solving the Social Influence Maximization problem. Several algorithm have been implemented for solving the influence maximization problem using a cascade model when the probabilities of the edges are known. 

There is also an implementation of the Linear UCB1 algorithm that solves the problem without knowing the probabilities of the edges. It assumes a linear model for estimating the proabilities on the edges basing on the features of the nodes. It uses this model to estimates the probabilities and then it solves the influence maximization problem.
